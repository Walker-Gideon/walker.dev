        <p>
          My journey into front-end development started with a simple curiosity
          for how websites worked — and quickly turned into a passion for
          building clean, functional, and engaging user experiences. I love
          turning ideas into interactive designs using tools like React,
          Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
          <br />
          <br />
          What drives me is the constant learning and problem-solving that comes
          with being a developer. I'm committed to improving my skills daily,
          writing code that’s both efficient and readable, and creating
          interfaces that feel just right for users.
